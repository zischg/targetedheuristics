Comparison of different flood vulnerability functions including targeted heuristics

In flood risk management, the choice of vulnerability functions has a remarkable impact on the overall uncertainty of modelling chains from rainfall to flood damages. The spatial transferability of empirical vulnerability functions is limited, leading to the need for computation and validation of region-specific vulnerability functions. In data-scarce regions however, this option is not feasible. In contrast, the physical processes of flood impact model chains can be developed in these regions because of the availability of global datasets (e.g., meteorological re-analyses and terrain data). 

Here, a flood vulnerability function is shown that has been developed by expert-based targeted heuristics. It can be implemented in coupled hydrologic-hydraulic model chains for analysing flood damage at building scale. 

The synthetic vulnerability function is compared with other vulnerability functions: 
(1) an ensemble of vulnerability functions available from the literature, 
(2) an individual vulnerability function calibrated with region-specific data, and 
(3) the vulnerability function used in flood risk management by the Swiss government.
